## Initial setup, build tools and dependencies

Friendly Pix iOS is built using Swift and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup). The Auth flow is built using [Firebase-UI](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-ios). Dependencies are managed using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/). Additionally server-side micro-services are built on [Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions).

Simply install the pods and open the .xcworkspace file to see the project in Xcode.

```
$ pod install
$ open your-project.xcworkspace
```

## Create Firebase Project

1. Create a Firebase project using the [Firebase Console](https://firebase.google.com/console).
1. To add the FriendlyPix app to a Firebase project, use the bundleID `com.google.firebase.friendlypix`.
1. Download the generated `GoogleService-Info.plist` file, and copy it to the root directory of this app.

### Google Sign In Setup

  - Select the **Auth** panel and then click the **Sign In Method** tab.
  - Click **Google** and turn on the **Enable** switch, then click **Save**.
- Open your regular `Info.plist`, navigate to `URL types > Item 0 > URL schemes`, and replace the value
  of `YOUR_REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` with the value of `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` from the GoogleService-Info.plist`.
- Run the app on your device or simulator.
    - Select **Sign In** and select Google to begin.

### Facebook Login Setup
- Go to the [Facebook Developers Site](https://developers.facebook.com) and follow all
  instructions to set up a new iOS app. When asked for a bundle ID, use
  `com.google.firebase.quickstart.AuthenticationExample`.

  - Select the **Auth** panel and then click the **Sign In Method** tab.
  - Click **Facebook** and turn on the **Enable** switch, then click **Save**.
  - Enter your Facebook **App Id** and **App Secret** and click **Save**.

  Facebook app you just created, e.g 124567. Save that file.
- In the *Info* tab of your target settings add a *URL Type* with a *URL Scheme* of 'fb' + the ID
  of your Facebook app, e.g. fb1234567.
- Run the app on your device or simulator.
    - Select **Sign In** and select Facebook to begin.
